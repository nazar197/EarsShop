# EarsShop

A small responsive landing page for a headphones shop. This project is built by using modern CSS(grid, flex, media queries, CSS variables). Also, for creating a photo gallery that allows displaying the images in a full screen, I've used SimpleLightbox(a lightweight and responsive lightbox library based on jQuery).
